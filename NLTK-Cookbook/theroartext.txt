Wallabies captain James Horwill has been cleared following an extraordinary International Rugby Board Appeal heard overnight.
Horwill will play in Saturday night’s third and deciding Test against the British & Irish Lions, after Independent Appeal Officer Graeme Mew, from Canada, this morning declined to uphold an IRB Appeal brought against Horwill after he was cleared of a foul play charge at a previous judicial hearing.
The judicial process has weighed down on the Wallabies, but the ultimate clearing of Horwill is a boost to the side ahead of the final Test in Sydney.
The Wallabies captain was initially cleared by Judicial Officer Nigel Hampton QC who found that on the balance of probabilities he could not find an intentional or deliberate action of stamping or trampling.
Horwill was alleged to have stamped or trampled on British & Irish Lions’ lock, Alun Wyn Jones, in the third minute of the opening Test of the Australia 2013 Lions Tour in Brisbane on Saturday 22 June.
